Langchain-based agentic system

Program state is maintained in a singleton class called SystemState
Agents communicate with each other by updating the global SystemState fields

Has 4 agents on the team:
1. information retriever
    a. generate keywords from question using LLM
    b. find columns and "entities" similar to keywords using embedding similarity searches
    c. context retrieval - ??
2. schema selector
3. candidate generator
4. unit tester



Preprocessing: the preprocssing of the benchmark / database is quite extensive and relies heavily on a bespoke data / directory structure of bird-sql.

TODO: Will need to adapt this to the SKALPEL benchmark data structure by injecting the NlSqlBenchmark class into the preprocessing script.

Implementation plan:
0. Incorporate necessary chess requirements into skalpel venv
1. Modify preprocessing script to make compatible with SKALPEL benchmark class structure
2. Write ChessSubsetter class to implement the first two agents (information retriever and schema selector) that can produce a schema subset using the Chess internals.
